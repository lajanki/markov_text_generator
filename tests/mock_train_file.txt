“Defunding Police would be good for Robbers & Rapists.”
BIG DEMAND! Starting up again soon, maybe next week!
Should have let police do their job and brought in National Guard on Day One, not Day Four!
Minnesota needs DJT & NOW. When I insisted on the National Guard, things got better FAST. Enough with Omar, you’ll have nothing left!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
THE REAWAKENING OF AMERICA!
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS!
Mattis was our Country’s most overrated General. He talked a lot, but never “brought home the bacon.” He was terrible! Someday I will tell the real story on him and others - both good and bad!
Poll: Trump Better Than Biden On Economic Growth, 55% to 34%. That’s all? Who are the 34%?
Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment. I watched, he fell harder than was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?
NASDAQ HITS ALL-TIME HIGH!
Vote today for Big Jim, a great Governor. Love West Virginia!
A GREAT Senator. Must return to Washington. Steve has my Complete & Total Endorsement!
“Democrats & Activists call to Defund Police Departments. They’ve gone so far Left that they eat their young.”




I have retained highly respected pollster, McLaughlin & Associates, to analyze todays CNN Poll (and others), which I felt were FAKE based on the incredible enthusiasm we are receiving. Read analysis for yourself. This is the same thing they and others did when we defeated...
I am to happy announce that Navy Veteran, Michael White, who has been detained by Iran for 683 days, is on a Swiss plane that just left Iranian Airspace. We expect him to be home with his family in America very soon....

The Fake Newspaper!
True!
Mueller should have never been appointed, although he did prove that I must be the most honest man in America!
How are they doing together?
So many people hurt!
No. Roger was a victim of a corrupt and illegal Witch Hunt, one which will go down as the greatest political crime in history. He can sleep well at night!
Interesting!
Great Book. Make Charlie Number One Again!
Section 230!
Good work Ted!
Thank you Matt!
Unfair!
This Witch Hunt should never have begun!
Nasty!
Caught!
This year has seen the lowest crime numbers in our Country’s recorded history, and now the Radical Left Democrats want to Defund and Abandon our Police. Sorry, I want LAW & ORDER!
Big day for Stock Market. Smart money, and the World, know that we are heading in the right direction. Jobs coming back FAST. Next year will be our greatest ever!
96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
The Lamestream Media refuses to talk about our Country’s record setting Jobs Numbers, which are indicating GREATNESS, and soon!
CNN Polls are as Fake as their Reporting. Same numbers, and worse, against Crooked Hillary. The Dems would destroy America!
LAW & ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE. The Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!
Tremendous sincerity, what a guy. Hard to believe, with this kind of political talent, his numbers would “tank” so badly in Utah!
Actually, a great book by a great and highly respected historian, Doug Wead!
Could it be even remotely possible that in Roger Goodell’s rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation, he was intimating that it would now be O.K. for the players to KNEEL, or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country & our Flag?
Colin Powell was a pathetic interview today on Fake News CNN. In his time, he was weak & gave away everything to everybody - so bad for the USA. Also got the “weapons of mass destruction” totally wrong, and you know what that mistake cost us? Sad! Only negative questions asked.
If I wasn’t constantly harassed for three years by fake and illegal investigations, Russia, Russia, Russia, and the Impeachment Hoax, I’d be up by 25 points on Sleepy Joe and the Do Nothing Democrats. Very unfair, but it is what it is!!!
is a SUPERSTAR running against a Lamb, to be exact, a weak puppet of crazy Nancy Pelosi!
I built the greatest economy in the World, the best the U.S. has ever had. I am doing it again!
Opinion Editor at just walked out. That’s right, he quit over the excellent Op-Ed penned by our great Senator TRANSPARENCY! The State of Arkansas is very proud of Tom. The New York Times is Fake News!!!
“If Biden had any passion or respect for law enforcement, he kept it well hidden in his Philadelphia address. He criticized cops far more than he did arsonists & looters.” Michael Goodwin,
is a spectacular man. An Admiral in the Navy, he is a brave and loyal Warrior who loves our Military and Vets. As a medical doctor, Ronny is great on HealthCare and he is Strong on Cutting Taxes, the Border and the Second Amendment...

Somebody please tell highly overrated Colin Powell that I will have gotten almost 300 Federal Judges approved (a record), Two Great Supreme Court Justices, rebuilt our once depleted Military, Choice for Vets, Biggest Ever Tax & Regulation Cuts, Saved Healthcare & 2A, & much more!
Fantastic job on by new Republican Superstar running for Congress (with my complete & total Endorsement) against a Crazy Nancy Pelosi Puppet (who has done nothing!), & a slightly older Republican Superstar, Thank you to both!
Colin Powell, a real stiff who was very responsible for getting us into the disastrous Middle East Wars, just announced he will be voting for another stiff, Sleepy Joe Biden. Didn’t Powell say that Iraq had “weapons of mass destruction?” They didn’t, but off we went to WAR!
Not only will Sleepy Joe Biden DEFUND THE POLICE, but he will DEFUND OUR MILITARY! He has no choice, the Dems are controlled by the Radical Left.
I have just given an order for our National Guard to start the process of withdrawing from Washington, D.C., now that everything is under perfect control. They will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed. Far fewer protesters showed up last night than anticipated!
Sleepy Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats want to “DEFUND THE POLICE”. I want great and well paid LAW ENFORCEMENT. I want LAW & ORDER!
& MSDNC are doing everything possible to “inflame” the crowd. Fortunately they have a very small audience!
Much smaller crowd in D.C. than anticipated. National Guard, Secret Service, and D.C. Police have been doing a fantastic job. Thank you!
LAW & ORDER!
Wow! 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party (and I believe this was before the “GREAT” Jobs Numbers yesterday). Thank you!


Riot gear or military control is not necessary because ANTIFA & other Wacko groups of Anarchists aren’t present to cause trouble. Incredible people. Thank you Maine!
Great new book by called “Nothing to Lose”. The Pastor is a winner and a great guy. Much can be learned from him. Buy the book. Make him a Big Deal Author!
“This is a flat out lie. They (the media) are making things up” The Lamestream Media is out of control. It would be impossible to fully explain how dishonest they are!
Crazy!
Biden wants to Defund the Police!
We will always defend. Great job Jay!
You must be kidding??? This is a total disgrace!
THANK YOU MAINE!
Twitter Pulls Trump Campaign Video of President Showing Empathy For Peaceful Protesters They are fighting hard for the Radical Left Democrats. A one sided battle. Illegal. Section 230!

New York City put on an 11:00 P.M. CURFEW last night. No wonder they ripped the place apart. Should be 7:00 P.M. CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD.
SILENT MAJORITY!
NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast! Don’t make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!!!
Republicans, get out and vote today for those great candidates that will lead to big victories on November 3rd. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Vaccines are coming along really well. Likewise therapeutics. Moving faster than anticipated. Good news ahead (in many ways)!
Yesterday was a bad day for the Cuomo Brothers. New York was lost to the looters, thugs, Radical Left, and all others forms of Lowlife & Scum. The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces. Likewise, Fredo’s ratings are down 50%!

D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!).
In 3 1/2 years, I’ve done much more for our Black population than Joe Biden has done in 43 years. Actually, he set them back big time with his Crime Bill, which he doesn’t even remember. I’ve done more for Black Americans, in fact, than any President in U.S. history, with...
If you watch Fake News or MSDNC, you would think that the killers, terrorists, arsonists, anarchists, thugs, hoodlums, looters, ANTIFA & others, would be the nicest, kindest most wonderful people in the Whole Wide World. No, they are what they are - very bad for our Country!
Really sick to watch the Fake and totally Slanted News(?) coming out of MSDNC and CNN. It bears NO relationship to the Truth or Facts. They are merely offshoots of the DNC, much like the and the Amazon Just like 2016, but worse. Sad, but we will win big!
LAW & ORDER!
Congratulations to Randy Feenstra on your big win in the Iowa Republican Primary. You will be a great Congressman!
The knew it was Fake and went with it anyway. Lamestream Media is CORRUPT!
The National Guard is ready!
Get tough police!
Undercover Huber is a great spoof, funny, but at the same time sad, because the real did absolutely NOTHING. He was a garbage disposal unit for important documents & then, tap, tap, tap, just drag it along & run out of time. A.G. Jeff Sessions was played like a drum!
Fredo’s ratings are down more than 50%. People are tired of his act. IS DYING!
So true!
Thank you Ted. They got caught cold, but this should never be allowed to happen to an incoming administration again - Spied on. Makes Watergate look like small potatoes! OBAMAGATE!
I agree, unlike other states that are poorly run & managed, Texas is in great shape...and the Southern Border Wall, which is going up FAST, puts it in even better position!
So pathetic to watch the Fake News Lamestream Media playing down the gravity and depravity of the Radical Left, looters and thugs, ripping up our Liberal Democrat run (only) cities. It is almost like they are all working together?
Burgess Owens, Utah. “We weren’t to sure in 2016, but we voted for the right person to take us through this process.” Thank you Burgess. Working hard!
New York’s Finest are not being allowed to perform their MAGIC but regardless, and with the momentum that the Radical Left and others have been allowed to build, they will need additional help. NYC is totally out of control. & MUST PUT DOWN RIOTING NOW!
“Chaos, lawlessness, and destruction take over New York.” When will Governor Cuomo call the Federal Government for help?
Media Falsely Claimed Violent Riots Were Peaceful And That Tear Gas Was Used Against Rioters Fake News is hurting our Country so badly. Don’t burn down churches. This article is a must read!
You got it wrong! If the protesters were so peaceful, why did they light the Church on fire the night before? People liked my walk to this historic place of worship! Sen. Susan Collins, Sen. James Lankford, Sen. Ben Sasse. Please read below.
Our highest respect to the family of David Dorn, a Great Police Captain from St. Louis, who was viciously shot and killed by despicable looters last night. We honor our police officers, perhaps more than ever before. Thank you!
Incredible! just took Congressional Hearing off the air just prior to important witness statements. More like CNN!!! Fox is lost!!!
Great statement to Congress by concerning Defunding (not!) our great Police. This Radical Left agenda is not going to happen. Sleepy Joe Biden will be (already is) pulled all the way Left. Many, like Minneapolis, want to close their Police Departments. Crazy!
“For the first time in history, Police Organizations & National Security Organizations were used to SPY on a Campaign, & there was no basis for it. The media largely drove that, & claims were made that could have affected the election of the President.” A.G. Bill Barr
New York State is killing small businesses. Let them properly open!
NASDAQ HITS ALL-TIME HIGH. Tremendous progress being made, way ahead of schedule. USA!

Thank you George, great honor!

I am allocating $2.96 BILLION in Emergency Solutions Grants to support homeless Americans and those at risk of becoming homeless because of job or wage loss, or illness due to COVID-19. We are taking care of our Nation’s most vulnerable citizens. Thanks
My decision to appoint General Charles Brown as the USA’s first-ever African American military service chief has now been approved by the Senate. A historic day for America! Excited to work even more closely with Gen. Brown, who is a Patriot and Great Leader!
