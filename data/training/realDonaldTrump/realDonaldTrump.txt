Senator Luther Strange, who is doing a great job for the people of Alabama, will be on at 7:15.

Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!  Senator Mitch McConnell said I had "excessive expectations," but I don't think so.

The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia... ...and did not want to "rock the boat." He didn't "choke," he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good. The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win.. The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS, they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare! Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!

The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN! Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck! At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!"

Dishonest! Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: "In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity." So true! slaughter you. This is a purely religious threat, which turned into reality. Such hatred! When will the U.S., and all countries, fight back? The terrorist who killed so many people in Germany said just before crime, "by God's will we will slaughter you pigs, I swear, we will......

Very impressive people! I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss! I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states! Yes, it is true - Carlos Slim, the great businessman from Mexico, called me about getting together for a meeting. We met, HE IS A GREAT GUY! especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more). They focused on wrong states Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations). He "doesn't know much" ... Congratulations to officially elected President of the United States today by the Electoral College!" Congratulations to President-elect electoral votes are in and it's official." Thank you Franklin! We did it! Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media). Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking! If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names! We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it! Thank you Alabama!

Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th. Unless you catch "hackers" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking.

Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!

Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are! The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!

Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con. Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible! Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying "sources said," DO NOT believe it. There are no sources, they are just made up lies!

Crazy Maureen Dowd, the wacky columnist for the failing pretends she knows me well--wrong! Wacky who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope! just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life!

Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me, beat failed announcer Bakari Sellers, so badly. Funny! Jeff Zucker failed and he is now failing is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign. The documentary of me that just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke! Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail. More poll results from last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Last nights results - in poll taken by NBC. With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted. Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto. Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!

As a tribute to the late, great Phyllis Schlafly, I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP. China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!

Heading to Youngstown, Ohio now- some great polls. Thank you American Legion Post 610- for hosting & I for a roundtable with labor leaders.

Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening? To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. I will fix it, VOTE "T" The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails? The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad! The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as if it is going to stop illegal immigration. CNN is so biased. Never ever watch them. Trump 2016!!" Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term! Wow, the failing has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.

You need to show the crowds at the rallies use Periscope! Show HC's 139 YT viewers vs DT 38K" TRUMP VICTORY IN NOVEMBER! Video: Hillary referring to blacks as super predators that need to be brought to heel. I heard that was very nice on Friday but that little Donny D, a big failure in TV (& someone I helped), was nasty. Irrelevant! Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street. Media is protecting her! I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds, but the media refuses to show or discuss them. Something very big is happening!

Just as we won the Cold War, in part, by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets.... Cont: This is my pledge to the American people: 'It's just a 2-point race, Clinton 38%, Trump 36%' Another health insurer is pulling back due to 'persistent financial losses on plans.' Only the beginning!  "CLINTON REFUGEE PLAN COULD BRING IN 620,000 REFUGEES IN FIRST TERM AT LIFETIME COST OF OVER $400 BILLION."  Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad! "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents! I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so! It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false! I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it! Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose! My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm. If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20% The failing which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said The failing talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary! You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people Loves U" Thanks We're all enjoying you, as well, Mr. T.! You've inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America! God bless you!" Nice yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!!" We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres. Thank you for all that you are doing for us! You campaign endlessly and have spent millions.We love you! Thanks I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th! The failing has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest! Will be on tonight at 10pm, hosted by Enjoy! Thank you Erie, Pennsylvania! Together we will Unbelievable support in Florida last night - thank you! ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts! I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't! A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday! Thank you for coming to Pennsylvania today. I will be there with your 3rd CD delegate at 2 pm" Ratings challenged reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS, & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM? People gotta stop believing media lies about Trump." That would indeed be nice! THE CORRUPT MEDIA CREATS CONTROVERSY AGAINST TO AVOID ISSUES ABOUT HillaryClinton Everything coming from this administration is a lie. Only will change it" Will be doing tonight at 8pm. Enjoy! This is no surprise. Constant phony reporting from failing turns everyone off. The American people get it! Thank you Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber. Reuters just announced that Secret Service never spoke to me or my campaign. Made up story by is a hoax. Totally dishonest. Really admire your determination: Working so hard for all Americans n daily having to defend yourself from a biased Media."  Thank you Abingdon, Virginia! No such meeting or conversation ever happened - a made up story by "low ratings" Great meeting w/ coal miners & leaders from the Virginia coal industry- thank you! I will be interviewed on tonight at 7pm. Enjoy! My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers shot in Sebastian County, Arkansas. Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and - sad & irrelevant! You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on Don Lemon is a lightweight - dumb as a rock ‘Now cut off my mic!’ Bongino refuses to be bullied by Don Lemon over Trump, 2nd Amendment – HEATED! Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution! When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails? Thank you Senator Thank you Thank you Wilmington, North Carolina! Loved Trump's answers to voters questions this morning! Trump's economic plan will help great interview.....all solid points on our economy TRUMP2016" I am running against the Washington insiders, just like I did in the Republican Primaries.

'As Senator Clinton promised 200,000 jobs in Upstate New York - her efforts fell flat.'

Join me in Fayetteville, North Carolina tomorrow evening at 6pm. Tickets now available at: "Will Media Apologize to Trump?" Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A., and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky! The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, "the baby" and so much more. Very dishonest! I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard. Look at the job she has done in Baltimore. She is a joke! Thank you Windham, New Hampshire! - 'Donald Trump Is the middle-class growth candidate' I am not just running against Crooked Hillary Clinton, I am running against the very dishonest and totally biased media - but I will win! is not fit to be our next president! Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED, and other things! Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED." Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous! Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens! Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens! Good luck 'Trump is right about violent crime: It’s on the rise in major cities' Thank you Green Bay, Wisconsin! Governor and I will be back soon. DON'T LET HILLARY CLINTON DO IT AGAIN! Thank you Des Moines, Iowa! Governor and I appreciate your support!  Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President. The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran! President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding. I won't dodge questions as your President. Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression! President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie. See you tomorrow w/ Gov. Iowa & Wisconsin! 3pm- 7pm- Thank you Portland, Maine! Happy 226th Birthday to the United States Coast Guard. Thank you Great meeting all of you. This group knocked on 50K doors & counting here in Maine, thank you! Looking forward to IA & WI with Gov. Pence, tomorrow. Join us! Thank you Jacksonville, Florida! Thank you for your support of my candidacy! Thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers today- in Daytona Beach, Florida! THANK YOU Daytona Beach, Florida! Our incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran. Scandal! There is great unity in my campaign, perhaps greater than ever before. I want to thank everyone for your tremendous support. Beat Crooked H! Great day in Virginia. Crowd was fantastic! My daughter will be on tonight at 7pm. Enjoy! Report raises questions about ‘Clinton Cash’ from Russians during ‘reset' President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States! John Podesta’s Brother Pocketed $180,000 from Putin’s Uranium Company:  Join me in Florida tomorrow! Daytona | 3pm- Jacksonville | 7pm- STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAILED LEADERSHIP: Thank you Virginia! The Washington Post calls out for what she REALLY is. A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR! Watch that nose grow! Great afternoon in Ohio & a great evening in Pennsylvania - departing now. See you tomorrow Virginia! Just leaving Mechanicsburg, PA. Incredible crowd-- so enthusiastic! Will be back soon. Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win! Thanks to for your kind words, very much appreciated. Join me in Florida on Wednesday! Daytona & Jacksonville: Daytona | 3pm- Jacksonville | 7pm- During the GOP convention, CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They don’t want them heard. When will CNN do a segment on Hillary’s plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost? Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam. Hillary, whose decisions have led to the deaths of many, accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN. Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors. Thank you Columbus, Ohio! I will be back soon. Thank you Oklahoma & Virginia! People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something! The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life. Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary? When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department? CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs. CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton. Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno, Nevada- tonight at 7pm! Tickets available at:  So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said! When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea! This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart! Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice! Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing is a joke. is laughable! Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. and her only hope." The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H? I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me! Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it! Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP 32.2 MILLION. CLINTON 27.8 MILLION. Thank you! Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention over Crooked Hillary and DEMS. Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! NATO commander agrees members should pay up via Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like! The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END! Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA? I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better! Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings  Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster! Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities. Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds! While I am in OH & PA - you can also join in Nevada on Mon! Carson City: Reno: Join me Monday in Columbus, Ohio & Harrisburg, Pennsylvania! 3pm in OH: 7pm in PA: American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs. WE will bring back the 'American Dream!' We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not. Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes. Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country. ONLY TRUMP CAN UNITE AMERICA AND FIX OBAMA'S MISTAKES!!! Thank you Denver, Colorado! As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable! Job Application Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts. Thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers in Colorado! Thank you Colorado Springs. Get out & VOTE in November! "Only a Reagan or a Trump-like figure in the White House will achieve this goal." Even Bill is tired of the lies, SAD! Join me in Colorado Springs at 2pm- or in Denver tonight at 7pm! Colorado Springs: Denver: What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton. I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change! Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick! In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse. The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal! Thank you! Facebook: Instagram: Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her! If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town! "Little" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster! General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications! Join at the University of Northwestern Ohio- tonight at 7pm. Tickets: "I believe in science" Dem code for "we're shutting down coal mines, steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing"" CAMPAIGN STATEMENT: Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER! Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream! The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. and the little watched = SAD! No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world. Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street! Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country. Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This is a MOVEMENT!  "Dems warn not to underestimate Trump's potential win" Great to be back in Iowa! with joining me in Davenport- this past winter. Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton. A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees. AMERICA'S FUTURE Bernie caved! Poll: Donald Trump Sees 17-Point Positive Swing in Two Weeks - Breitbart Great! President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesn’t exist. 70% of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. stay the course mr trump your message is resonating with the PEOPLE" Barack is offended that will demand that allies pay their fair share. Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair. Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers! Join me live in Toledo, Ohio!  Thank you Pennsylvania! Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! "Trump right: Illegal families crossing border set to double, 51,152 so far" Great new poll - thank you! If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI! Join our next Vice President, in Wisconsin tonight & Michigan Thursday! MI: WI: Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz! Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO! Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough! The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD! Funny how the failing is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st! As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep? I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention! No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated! You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia. In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy! Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here. Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed! The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar! Thank you New Hampshire! Join us in Toledo, Ohio- tomorrow night at 8pm! Tickets: Join us tomorrow in Scranton, Pennsylvania at 3pm! Tickets: Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch. Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great Funny, if you listen to the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time. Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated! Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself. I was at and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air! Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke! While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War. Thank you OHIO! Thank you Roanoke, Virginia- be back soon! MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!  Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE! Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn! Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance! Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie. If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. Thank you! Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie! The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing! The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you! The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out! The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well! Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook! Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild The panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN! I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! Today proves what I have always known, that Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite! Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!  Dinesh D'Sousa Hillary's America. see it" Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart! The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me! I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs! Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer! Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back! Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA. Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her! Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing! The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight? General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam. Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did? Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich. One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times! What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic! MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE NOMINATION! You can watch 360 video live from the podium! This is a MOVEMENT! Thank you Proud of you! Great job Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united. Great love in the arena! Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all! I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. Ivanka intros me tonight! Great job Proud of you! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Arena was packed, totally electric! was fantastic tonight. Will be a great V.P. Our next Vice President of the United States of America, Gov. Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal! Great job Proud of you! Thank you Thank you to Governor for such warm support. Great speech! Thank you  Watching the John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days! STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails. Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press! In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs! Bill Hemmer of was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years. Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you! Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST! The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!   Democrats are coming to TRUMP. I used to be proud of the dem party. No more It is crooked and not for the people." It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud! Will be on tonight at 8:30pm prior to Melania's speech at the Tune in- she will do great!  Networks other than low ratings have been very fair and exciting! is the worst.They go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump!

Thank you Mahoning County, Ohio! See you soon! President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!

DonaldTrump and his running mate to appear on in first joint interview. CBS I will be on tonight at 7:00 P.M. with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects! Bad times for divided USA! We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today. How many law enforcement and people have to... The ratings at blow away the ratings of - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like is much better, and far more truthful, than which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch. If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud! It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement! As the days and weeks go by, we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions! We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud.

Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money! Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!

My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice, France. We are with you in every way! In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement. Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France.

I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow. If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions! Even the and Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking? Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge! On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others. Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity. Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone falls flat in nationwide Having ZERO impact. Sad!! Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know! The Republican platform is most pro-Israel of all time! New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! is outspending me by a combined 31 to 1 in Florida, Ohio, & Pennsylvania. I haven't started yet! Thank you Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania! is not qualified. Thank you!

No free pass for To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first. Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs. is not qualified! I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out! Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry! This election is a choice between law, order & safety - or chaos, crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need. Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!

Tickets: I heard that the underachieving John King of on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily, few people are watching - dead network! The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid! President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe! Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation! New poll - thank you! Way to go - you are a true champion. Proud of you! MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on Due to the horrific events taking place in our country, I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami. Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country After today, Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.

Great being in Cincinnati, Ohio last night- thank you! Off to Washington D.C. now. Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also? Dishonest media! To all of my twitter followers, please contribute whatever you can to the campaign. We must beat Crooked Hillary. Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live. I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C. Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City. Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies. Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come! The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement. Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit! Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT! I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out! Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win I will be interviewed by tonight on at 11pm. Enjoy! My son, will be interviewed by tonight at 10pm on Enjoy! Looking forward to meeting with in a little while. We will be traveling to North Carolina together today. FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment. It was great spending time with yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again! Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace! On at 7:00 P.M. "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy! Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays? With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM! Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails? The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked! I look forward to meeting today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa! Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people! Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid! Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star! Happy 4th of July! Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change! The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this! In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed! I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught! The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures." Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac? "THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!" On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil! Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt! Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know. Just watched and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it! It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged! It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!
